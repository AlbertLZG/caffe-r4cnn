# Caffe RC1 with Render for CNN accuracy and loss layers

This is Caffe RC1, except the view accuracy and view loss layers from Render for CNN are included. Think of this as an updated version of [caffe-render-for-cnn](https://github.com/charlesq34/caffe-render-for-cnn).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thanks Charles R. Qi for the original view accuracy and view loss layers, and the general Caffe community for developing Caffe.
